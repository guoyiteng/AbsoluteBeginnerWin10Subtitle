00:00:05,204 --> 00:00:07,784
<v ->Hi I'm Bob Tabor and in this series of videos,</v>

2
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:09,331
over 75 videos,

3
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:10,813
I'm going to demonstrate how to build apps

4
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:15,813
that can be sold or downloaded for free on the Windows Store

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,066
for Windows desktop, or phone,

6
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:21,863
or wherever Universal Windows Platform apps can be used.

7
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:25,970
Which will soon include devices like the Xbox One,

8
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:29,383
Microsoft Hub, and even the HoloLens.

9
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:32,006
Now that term Universal Windows Platform I just used

10
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:35,419
it describes tools and APIs that you can utilize

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,460
to build apps that run universally

12
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:40,923
across all new Windows devices.

13
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:44,154
And the beauty is that you can write one application

14
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:48,966
and it'll look great on many different screen resolutions

15
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,609
and device form factors.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,051
And really that's one of the most important things

17
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,877
that I'm going to discuss and demonstrate

18
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,840
in this series of lessons.

19
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:01,231
So this series is intended for an absolute

20
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:03,407
beginner audience.

21
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:06,799
Having said that, you should already have some familiarity

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,612
with C# and Visual Studio.

23
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:11,780
And I want to assume that you're watching this after

24
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:15,417
making sure that you've either watched or at least

25
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:19,054
you understand all the concepts that I discuss in

26
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:22,020
the C# fundamentals for absolute beginners series

27
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:24,056
on Microsoft Virtual Academy in channel nine.

28
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:28,622
You can find it at this URL on the screen.

29
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,950
Now if you're already an experienced developer

30
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:34,776
then -- fair warning -- quite honestly here,

31
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:37,539
this course is going to move very slow for you.

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,375
And we did that on purpose.

33
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:41,710
And honestly there's probably some better resources

34
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,554
out there where you can spend your time.

35
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:47,639
I'd recommend that you watch Andy Wigley and Shen Chauhan

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,626
in a series that they created called

37
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:54,017
a developers guide to Windows 10.

38
00:01:54,018 --> 00:01:56,481
Great, up to date, it's awesome.

39
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:57,815
And I'd recommend you start there

40
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,726
if you're already an experienced developer.

41
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:04,257
Now this is the fourth version of this particular video

42
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,081
series that I've created.

43
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:09,643
And I started way back on the Windows Phone 7

44
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:11,734
in about 2009 / 2010.

45
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:14,614
Each time that I release a version of this series

46
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:17,728
I'm asked a few questions repeatedly.

47
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,722
So I want to answer those right up front

48
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:24,021
so that there's no misunderstanding.

49
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:28,597
First of all, you must use Windows 10

50
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,178
to build apps for Windows 10,

51
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:33,598
to build Universal Windows Platform apps.

52
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,065
You cannot use Windows 8.1, or Windows 8,

53
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,009
or Windows 7, or Windows XP.

54
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,201
Alright, you have to use Windows 10, that's number one.

55
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:45,950
Number two, you have to use Visual Studio 2015.

56
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,859
Now I recommend that you use

57
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,237
Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition,

58
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:54,312
which is a free edition with all the features of Pro edition

59
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:57,789
but it's intended for individuals who are just learning

60
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,183
or creating a community based projects.

61
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:05,874
Now frankly you can use other editions of Visual Studio

62
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,212
but not previous versions.

63
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:11,581
You must use version 2015 to build

64
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:13,255
Universal Windows Platform apps, that's number two.

65
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:18,255
Number three, you're going to see me use the phone emulator

66
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:22,940
in order to run and test my applications occasionally.

67
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:25,233
It'll look like a little phone running on my screen

68
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:27,366
with a little menu off to the right hand side.

69
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:31,494
It's actually running software called Hyper-V

70
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:35,846
which is a platform for running virtual machines

71
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:37,552
on your desktop.

72
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:41,371
And so it's running the Windows Phone 10 operating system

73
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:43,685
in a little virtual machine that looks like a phone.

74
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:46,266
Now you might need special hardware

75
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,610
to run the phone emulator.

76
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:52,559
Specifically your motherboard and your chip

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,087
must support a technology called SLAT,

78
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:57,903
or rather "Second Level Address Translation".

79
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,967
Now most modern motherboards will support this,

80
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:05,305
however not all motherboards and chips support this.

81
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:09,145
Most importantly, I can't help you with this.

82
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:12,781
I understand very little about it.

83
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:16,921
If you get errors during install of Visual Studio 2015

84
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,864
then you can search Microsoft's forums for help,

85
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:22,168
but again I can't help you.

86
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,112
I've tried to help in the past and honestly I've

87
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:27,608
probably confused more people than I've actually helped.

88
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,581
Now the worst case scenario if you can't get

89
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:32,386
the emulator running on your local machine,

90
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:36,024
is that you might need to deploy your apps

91
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,498
to a physical phone device running

92
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,876
either the full edition or a beta edition of Windows

93
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:45,079
Phone 10 for the purpose of testing.

94
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,177
It's simple to do,

95
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:47,905
however I don't demonstrate how to do that

96
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,100
in this series of videos.

97
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,073
There are articles online that'll show you how.

98
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:54,241
Now if you have all these things in place

99
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,075
then, number four, you're going to need to

100
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:57,719
turn on Developer Mode.

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,398
And the way that you get that is you open up Settings

102
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,067
in Windows 10 and you go to Update & Security.

103
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:08,671
And then on the left hand side you select For Developers,

104
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:11,455
and make sure to choose Developer mode.

105
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:13,791
And if it asks you to save then go ahead and save.

106
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:16,266
I'm not sure, I can't remember that particular part.

107
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:18,538
But make sure that you have that set.

108
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,821
Visual Studio will probably give you an error

109
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:23,092
if you first run an application if you don't

110
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:25,471
have that setting set up, okay?

111
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,924
Now this series of videos

112
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:32,031
is about 15 or 16 hours long, it's fairly comprehensive.

113
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,506
And one of the most important new features

114
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:37,822
of this training series is that I'm going to give you

115
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:40,499
homework assignments called challenges.

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,166
And I'll give you all the tools that you need

117
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:46,174
to build an app to my specifications

118
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:48,179
and then I'm even going to give you the solution

119
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,440
to the challenge in the form of a video

120
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,040
in case you get stuck.

121
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,208
And that's a great way for you,

122
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,735
and you should definitely do these challenges

123
00:05:57,736 --> 00:06:00,413
where you "get your hands dirty in the code"

124
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:01,650
as I like to say it.

125
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:03,623
We're also going to build a little cheat sheet

126
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,127
for review purposes,

127
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:07,100
and then you can reference it after you finish

128
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,295
the series of videos.

129
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:10,428
Feel free to add to the cheat sheet

130
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:12,423
anything that you think might be useful

131
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:15,302
as you go forward and start building your own applications.

132
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:18,172
And then finally in the last half of the series,

133
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:21,051
we're going to build four entire applications

134
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:25,872
and even one of them for inclusion in the Windows Store.

135
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,451
Now these apps are going to show you

136
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:30,459
how to think like an app developer

137
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,880
from concept through implementation.

138
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:37,264
And we'll use a variety of different techniques, and APIs,

139
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,482
and tools and approaches to learn how to

140
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,511
interact with sensors on a given device.

141
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:46,149
How to access media libraries,

142
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,042
how to access online services that provide weather updates.

143
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,721
And even allow us to tap into fun services

144
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:56,793
like Marvel comics web API,

145
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:59,758
that allow us to retrieve back all their characters

146
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,820
and look through them and look through the artwork.

147
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:07,704
Now many of the videos in the series will have a zip file

148
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:10,788
associated with them that contains the code

149
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,136
that I wrote while recording the video.

150
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,740
Or in the case of challenges like I just described

151
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:17,720
a moment ago,

152
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:20,355
it'll contain the images that you need, any instructions,

153
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,648
or any other files that'll be required

154
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,336
in order to actually perform that challenge.

155
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:28,418
Now the file will be on the page

156
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,246
where you're currently watching the video,

157
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:34,476
or where you originally downloaded the video from.

158
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:36,855
So please before you ask in the comments,

159
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,561
"I can't find the download link,

160
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:40,716
where's the download link, the download link!"

161
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:45,716
Please hit Control + f on your keyboard in your web browser

162
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:49,067
and search for the term "download".

163
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,872
If there's no link to download a file

164
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:56,566
then that particular video does not have files to download.

165
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:00,096
Please search for the term download first.

166
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:04,320
Now while this is a very inclusive set of videos

167
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:08,021
I mean 15 to 16 hours is a lot of content to go through.

168
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:09,866
This is still really just an introduction.

169
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,447
I can't possibly show you everything

170
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:17,045
that the Universal Windows Platform contains.

171
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:20,191
You should treat this as a gentle introduction only,

172
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:21,833
but you should always refer back to

173
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,428
Microsoft's own documentation at the Windows Dev Center

174
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:27,316
for comprehensive explanation

175
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:30,526
how to get the most out of Universal Windows Platform.

176
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:35,526
And you can access that at http://dev.windows.com

177
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,920
Now remember that you can't just watch

178
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:41,597
a screen cast tutorial training series

179
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:45,256
the way that you would watch a movie or a sitcom on TV.

180
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,188
You're going to need to become an active learner.

181
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:51,987
Don't be afraid to rewind or even rewatch an entire video

182
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:54,951
or a portion of the video if at first

183
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,086
something doesn't really make a lot of sense to you.

184
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,721
Or look at the documentation at the Windows Dev Center

185
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:02,876
at the link I just shared with you.

186
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:06,118
For more details surrounding the given topic

187
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:08,945
that we're discussing at that moment in the videos.

188
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:11,653
You learn best whenever you use different

189
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:16,603
modalities to learn the same idea, the same content.

190
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:20,272
And ultimately the videos that I'm presenting are just

191
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:23,195
one tool to help you realize your aspirations

192
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:27,120
of building apps for sale in the Windows Store.

193
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:29,477
Now, on a personal note if you like what I do here

194
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:30,842
please visit me at

195
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:35,842
http://www.LearnVisualStudio.NET

196
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:37,423
where I help beginners get their

197
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:39,396
first software development job

198
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:40,570
building Windows and web apps

199
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:42,340
into world's best companies.

200
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:44,793
There are tons of challenge exercises there

201
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:48,089
and deeper insights into writing software using

202
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,556
Visual Studio, and C#, and ASP.NET and more.

203
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,502
Alright now finally I'd like to take a moment and thank

204
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:58,628
the hundreds of thousands of people who have watched

205
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:01,006
the previous versions of this series.

206
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:04,579
And for those who took the time to actually tell Microsoft

207
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,022
that you wanted more of this type of training.

208
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,029
Your feedback made this happen,

209
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,394
so thank you very much.

210
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:15,352
Also I want to thank Andy Wigley who patiently answered

211
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:18,786
all of the questions that I had and gave me a ton of advice

212
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:20,226
while I was building this series.

213
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:21,613
I'm very thankful for his guidance

214
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,479
as I worked on these lessons.

215
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,417
And ultimately this series was championed primarily

216
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:31,479
by Clint Rutkas who has been involved in almost all of the

217
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,017
video projects that I have worked on for Microsoft.

218
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:36,545
Without Clint, none of this would be possible.

219
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:38,146
So please reach out to him on Twitter

220
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:40,299
and let him know how much you appreciate his good work.

221
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,510
Okay so enough setup.

222
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:48,510
You've got Visual Studio 2015 running on Windows 10

223
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,392
and you've turned on Developer mode in Settings

224
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:53,258
like we looked at just a moment ago,

225
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,784
and you're wondering what comes next.

226
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:56,939
Well we're going to get started in the very next video.

227
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,133
We'll see you there.
