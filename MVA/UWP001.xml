<p begin="00:00:05.204" id="p0" end="00:00:07.784">&lt;v -&gt;Hi I&#39;m Bob Tabor and in this series of videos,&lt;/v&gt;</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.785" id="p1" end="00:00:09.331">over 75 videos,</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.332" id="p2" end="00:00:10.813">I&#39;m going to demonstrate how to build apps</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.814" id="p3" end="00:00:15.813">that can be sold or downloaded for free on the Windows Store</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.030" id="p4" end="00:00:18.066">for Windows desktop, or phone,</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.067" id="p5" end="00:00:21.863">or wherever Universal Windows Platform apps can be used.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.864" id="p6" end="00:00:25.970">Which will soon include devices like the Xbox One,</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.971" id="p7" end="00:00:29.383">Microsoft Hub, and even the HoloLens.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.384" id="p8" end="00:00:32.006">Now that term Universal Windows Platform I just used</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.007" id="p9" end="00:00:35.419">it describes tools and APIs that you can utilize</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.420" id="p10" end="00:00:38.460">to build apps that run universally</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.461" id="p11" end="00:00:40.923">across all new Windows devices.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.924" id="p12" end="00:00:44.154">And the beauty is that you can write one application</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.155" id="p13" end="00:00:48.966">and it&#39;ll look great on many different screen resolutions</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.967" id="p14" end="00:00:50.609">and device form factors.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" id="p15" end="00:00:53.051">And really that&#39;s one of the most important things</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.052" id="p16" end="00:00:55.877">that I&#39;m going to discuss and demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.878" id="p17" end="00:00:57.840">in this series of lessons.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.841" id="p18" end="00:01:01.231">So this series is intended for an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.232" id="p19" end="00:01:03.407">beginner audience.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.408" id="p20" end="00:01:06.799">Having said that, you should already have some familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.800" id="p21" end="00:01:08.612">with C# and Visual Studio.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.613" id="p22" end="00:01:11.780">And I want to assume that you&#39;re watching this after</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.781" id="p23" end="00:01:15.417">making sure that you&#39;ve either watched or at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.418" id="p24" end="00:01:19.054">you understand all the concepts that I discuss in</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.055" id="p25" end="00:01:22.020">the C# fundamentals for absolute beginners series</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.021" id="p26" end="00:01:24.056">on Microsoft Virtual Academy in channel nine.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.057" id="p27" end="00:01:28.622">You can find it at this URL on the screen.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.623" id="p28" end="00:01:31.950">Now if you&#39;re already an experienced developer</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.951" id="p29" end="00:01:34.776">then -- fair warning -- quite honestly here,</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.777" id="p30" end="00:01:37.539">this course is going to move very slow for you.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.540" id="p31" end="00:01:39.375">And we did that on purpose.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.376" id="p32" end="00:01:41.710">And honestly there&#39;s probably some better resources</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.711" id="p33" end="00:01:43.554">out there where you can spend your time.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.555" id="p34" end="00:01:47.639">I&#39;d recommend that you watch Andy Wigley and Shen Chauhan</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" id="p35" end="00:01:50.626">in a series that they created called</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.627" id="p36" end="00:01:54.017">a developers guide to Windows 10.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.018" id="p37" end="00:01:56.481">Great, up to date, it&#39;s awesome.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.482" id="p38" end="00:01:57.815">And I&#39;d recommend you start there</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.816" id="p39" end="00:02:00.726">if you&#39;re already an experienced developer.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.727" id="p40" end="00:02:04.257">Now this is the fourth version of this particular video</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.258" id="p41" end="00:02:06.081">series that I&#39;ve created.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.082" id="p42" end="00:02:09.643">And I started way back on the Windows Phone 7</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.644" id="p43" end="00:02:11.734">in about 2009 / 2010.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.735" id="p44" end="00:02:14.614">Each time that I release a version of this series</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.615" id="p45" end="00:02:17.728">I&#39;m asked a few questions repeatedly.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.729" id="p46" end="00:02:19.722">So I want to answer those right up front</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.723" id="p47" end="00:02:24.021">so that there&#39;s no misunderstanding.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.022" id="p48" end="00:02:28.597">First of all, you must use Windows 10</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.598" id="p49" end="00:02:31.178">to build apps for Windows 10,</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.179" id="p50" end="00:02:33.598">to build Universal Windows Platform apps.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" id="p51" end="00:02:37.065">You cannot use Windows 8.1, or Windows 8,</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.066" id="p52" end="00:02:40.009">or Windows 7, or Windows XP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.010" id="p53" end="00:02:44.201">Alright, you have to use Windows 10, that&#39;s number one.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.202" id="p54" end="00:02:45.950">Number two, you have to use Visual Studio 2015.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.951" id="p55" end="00:02:47.859">Now I recommend that you use</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.860" id="p56" end="00:02:50.237">Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition,</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.238" id="p57" end="00:02:54.312">which is a free edition with all the features of Pro edition</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.313" id="p58" end="00:02:57.789">but it&#39;s intended for individuals who are just learning</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.790" id="p59" end="00:03:02.183">or creating a community based projects.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.184" id="p60" end="00:03:05.874">Now frankly you can use other editions of Visual Studio</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.875" id="p61" end="00:03:09.212">but not previous versions.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.213" id="p62" end="00:03:11.581">You must use version 2015 to build</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.582" id="p63" end="00:03:13.255">Universal Windows Platform apps, that&#39;s number two.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.256" id="p64" end="00:03:18.255">Number three, you&#39;re going to see me use the phone emulator</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.082" id="p65" end="00:03:22.940">in order to run and test my applications occasionally.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.941" id="p66" end="00:03:25.233">It&#39;ll look like a little phone running on my screen</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.234" id="p67" end="00:03:27.366">with a little menu off to the right hand side.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.367" id="p68" end="00:03:31.494">It&#39;s actually running software called Hyper-V</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.495" id="p69" end="00:03:35.846">which is a platform for running virtual machines</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.847" id="p70" end="00:03:37.552">on your desktop.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.553" id="p71" end="00:03:41.371">And so it&#39;s running the Windows Phone 10 operating system</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.372" id="p72" end="00:03:43.685">in a little virtual machine that looks like a phone.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.686" id="p73" end="00:03:46.266">Now you might need special hardware</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.267" id="p74" end="00:03:47.610">to run the phone emulator.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.611" id="p75" end="00:03:52.559">Specifically your motherboard and your chip</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" id="p76" end="00:03:55.087">must support a technology called SLAT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.088" id="p77" end="00:03:57.903">or rather &quot;Second Level Address Translation&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.904" id="p78" end="00:04:01.967">Now most modern motherboards will support this,</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.968" id="p79" end="00:04:05.305">however not all motherboards and chips support this.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.306" id="p80" end="00:04:09.145">Most importantly, I can&#39;t help you with this.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.146" id="p81" end="00:04:12.781">I understand very little about it.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.782" id="p82" end="00:04:16.921">If you get errors during install of Visual Studio 2015</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.922" id="p83" end="00:04:19.864">then you can search Microsoft&#39;s forums for help,</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.865" id="p84" end="00:04:22.168">but again I can&#39;t help you.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.169" id="p85" end="00:04:25.112">I&#39;ve tried to help in the past and honestly I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.113" id="p86" end="00:04:27.608">probably confused more people than I&#39;ve actually helped.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.609" id="p87" end="00:04:29.581">Now the worst case scenario if you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.582" id="p88" end="00:04:32.386">the emulator running on your local machine,</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.387" id="p89" end="00:04:36.024">is that you might need to deploy your apps</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.025" id="p90" end="00:04:38.498">to a physical phone device running</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.499" id="p91" end="00:04:40.876">either the full edition or a beta edition of Windows</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.877" id="p92" end="00:04:45.079">Phone 10 for the purpose of testing.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.080" id="p93" end="00:04:46.177">It&#39;s simple to do,</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.178" id="p94" end="00:04:47.905">however I don&#39;t demonstrate how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.906" id="p95" end="00:04:49.100">in this series of videos.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.101" id="p96" end="00:04:51.073">There are articles online that&#39;ll show you how.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.074" id="p97" end="00:04:54.241">Now if you have all these things in place</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.242" id="p98" end="00:04:56.075">then, number four, you&#39;re going to need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.076" id="p99" end="00:04:57.719">turn on Developer Mode.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.720" id="p100" end="00:05:01.398">And the way that you get that is you open up Settings</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.399" id="p101" end="00:05:05.067">in Windows 10 and you go to Update &amp; Security.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.068" id="p102" end="00:05:08.671">And then on the left hand side you select For Developers,</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.672" id="p103" end="00:05:11.455">and make sure to choose Developer mode.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.456" id="p104" end="00:05:13.791">And if it asks you to save then go ahead and save.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.792" id="p105" end="00:05:16.266">I&#39;m not sure, I can&#39;t remember that particular part.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.267" id="p106" end="00:05:18.538">But make sure that you have that set.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.539" id="p107" end="00:05:20.821">Visual Studio will probably give you an error</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.822" id="p108" end="00:05:23.092">if you first run an application if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.093" id="p109" end="00:05:25.471">have that setting set up, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.472" id="p110" end="00:05:27.924">Now this series of videos</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.925" id="p111" end="00:05:32.031">is about 15 or 16 hours long, it&#39;s fairly comprehensive.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.032" id="p112" end="00:05:34.506">And one of the most important new features</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.507" id="p113" end="00:05:37.822">of this training series is that I&#39;m going to give you</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.823" id="p114" end="00:05:40.499">homework assignments called challenges.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.500" id="p115" end="00:05:43.166">And I&#39;ll give you all the tools that you need</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.167" id="p116" end="00:05:46.174">to build an app to my specifications</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.175" id="p117" end="00:05:48.179">and then I&#39;m even going to give you the solution</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.180" id="p118" end="00:05:50.440">to the challenge in the form of a video</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.441" id="p119" end="00:05:52.040">in case you get stuck.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.041" id="p120" end="00:05:55.208">And that&#39;s a great way for you,</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.209" id="p121" end="00:05:57.735">and you should definitely do these challenges</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.736" id="p122" end="00:06:00.413">where you &quot;get your hands dirty in the code&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.414" id="p123" end="00:06:01.650">as I like to say it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.651" id="p124" end="00:06:03.623">We&#39;re also going to build a little cheat sheet</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.624" id="p125" end="00:06:05.127">for review purposes,</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.128" id="p126" end="00:06:07.100">and then you can reference it after you finish</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.101" id="p127" end="00:06:08.295">the series of videos.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.296" id="p128" end="00:06:10.428">Feel free to add to the cheat sheet</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.429" id="p129" end="00:06:12.423">anything that you think might be useful</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.424" id="p130" end="00:06:15.302">as you go forward and start building your own applications.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.303" id="p131" end="00:06:18.172">And then finally in the last half of the series,</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.173" id="p132" end="00:06:21.051">we&#39;re going to build four entire applications</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.052" id="p133" end="00:06:25.872">and even one of them for inclusion in the Windows Store.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.873" id="p134" end="00:06:27.451">Now these apps are going to show you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.452" id="p135" end="00:06:30.459">how to think like an app developer</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.460" id="p136" end="00:06:32.880">from concept through implementation.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.881" id="p137" end="00:06:37.264">And we&#39;ll use a variety of different techniques, and APIs,</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.265" id="p138" end="00:06:39.482">and tools and approaches to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.483" id="p139" end="00:06:42.511">interact with sensors on a given device.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.512" id="p140" end="00:06:46.149">How to access media libraries,</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.150" id="p141" end="00:06:50.042">how to access online services that provide weather updates.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.043" id="p142" end="00:06:53.721">And even allow us to tap into fun services</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.722" id="p143" end="00:06:56.793">like Marvel comics web API,</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.794" id="p144" end="00:06:59.758">that allow us to retrieve back all their characters</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" id="p145" end="00:07:02.820">and look through them and look through the artwork.</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.821" id="p146" end="00:07:07.704">Now many of the videos in the series will have a zip file</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.705" id="p147" end="00:07:10.788">associated with them that contains the code</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.789" id="p148" end="00:07:14.136">that I wrote while recording the video.</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.137" id="p149" end="00:07:16.740">Or in the case of challenges like I just described</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.741" id="p150" end="00:07:17.720">a moment ago,</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.721" id="p151" end="00:07:20.355">it&#39;ll contain the images that you need, any instructions,</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.356" id="p152" end="00:07:22.648">or any other files that&#39;ll be required</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.649" id="p153" end="00:07:25.336">in order to actually perform that challenge.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.337" id="p154" end="00:07:28.418">Now the file will be on the page</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.419" id="p155" end="00:07:32.246">where you&#39;re currently watching the video,</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.247" id="p156" end="00:07:34.476">or where you originally downloaded the video from.</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.477" id="p157" end="00:07:36.855">So please before you ask in the comments,</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.856" id="p158" end="00:07:38.561">&quot;I can&#39;t find the download link,</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.562" id="p159" end="00:07:40.716">where&#39;s the download link, the download link!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.717" id="p160" end="00:07:45.716">Please hit Control + f on your keyboard in your web browser</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.326" id="p161" end="00:07:49.067">and search for the term &quot;download&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.068" id="p162" end="00:07:51.872">If there&#39;s no link to download a file</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.873" id="p163" end="00:07:56.566">then that particular video does not have files to download.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.567" id="p164" end="00:08:00.096">Please search for the term download first.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.097" id="p165" end="00:08:04.320">Now while this is a very inclusive set of videos</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.321" id="p166" end="00:08:08.021">I mean 15 to 16 hours is a lot of content to go through.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.022" id="p167" end="00:08:09.866">This is still really just an introduction.</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.867" id="p168" end="00:08:12.447">I can&#39;t possibly show you everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.448" id="p169" end="00:08:17.045">that the Universal Windows Platform contains.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.046" id="p170" end="00:08:20.191">You should treat this as a gentle introduction only,</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.192" id="p171" end="00:08:21.833">but you should always refer back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.834" id="p172" end="00:08:25.428">Microsoft&#39;s own documentation at the Windows Dev Center</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.429" id="p173" end="00:08:27.316">for comprehensive explanation</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.317" id="p174" end="00:08:30.526">how to get the most out of Universal Windows Platform.</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.527" id="p175" end="00:08:35.526">And you can access that at http://dev.windows.com</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.319" id="p176" end="00:08:38.920">Now remember that you can&#39;t just watch</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.921" id="p177" end="00:08:41.597">a screen cast tutorial training series</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.598" id="p178" end="00:08:45.256">the way that you would watch a movie or a sitcom on TV.</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.257" id="p179" end="00:08:48.188">You&#39;re going to need to become an active learner.</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.189" id="p180" end="00:08:51.987">Don&#39;t be afraid to rewind or even rewatch an entire video</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.988" id="p181" end="00:08:54.951">or a portion of the video if at first</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.952" id="p182" end="00:08:57.086">something doesn&#39;t really make a lot of sense to you.</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.087" id="p183" end="00:09:00.721">Or look at the documentation at the Windows Dev Center</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.722" id="p184" end="00:09:02.876">at the link I just shared with you.</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.877" id="p185" end="00:09:06.118">For more details surrounding the given topic</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.119" id="p186" end="00:09:08.945">that we&#39;re discussing at that moment in the videos.</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.946" id="p187" end="00:09:11.653">You learn best whenever you use different</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.654" id="p188" end="00:09:16.603">modalities to learn the same idea, the same content.</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.604" id="p189" end="00:09:20.272">And ultimately the videos that I&#39;m presenting are just</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.273" id="p190" end="00:09:23.195">one tool to help you realize your aspirations</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.196" id="p191" end="00:09:27.120">of building apps for sale in the Windows Store.</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.121" id="p192" end="00:09:29.477">Now, on a personal note if you like what I do here</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.424" id="p196" end="00:09:39.396">first software development job</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.397" id="p197" end="00:09:40.570">building Windows and web apps</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.571" id="p198" end="00:09:42.340">into world&#39;s best companies.</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.341" id="p199" end="00:09:44.793">There are tons of challenge exercises there</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.794" id="p200" end="00:09:48.089">and deeper insights into writing software using</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.090" id="p201" end="00:09:51.556">Visual Studio, and C#, and ASP.NET and more.</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.557" id="p202" end="00:09:55.502">Alright now finally I&#39;d like to take a moment and thank</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.503" id="p203" end="00:09:58.628">the hundreds of thousands of people who have watched</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.629" id="p204" end="00:10:01.006">the previous versions of this series.</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.007" id="p205" end="00:10:04.579">And for those who took the time to actually tell Microsoft</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.580" id="p206" end="00:10:07.022">that you wanted more of this type of training.</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.023" id="p207" end="00:10:10.029">Your feedback made this happen,</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.030" id="p208" end="00:10:11.394">so thank you very much.</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.395" id="p209" end="00:10:15.352">Also I want to thank Andy Wigley who patiently answered</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.353" id="p210" end="00:10:18.786">all of the questions that I had and gave me a ton of advice</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.787" id="p211" end="00:10:20.226">while I was building this series.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.227" id="p212" end="00:10:21.613">I&#39;m very thankful for his guidance</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.614" id="p213" end="00:10:23.479">as I worked on these lessons.</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.480" id="p214" end="00:10:28.417">And ultimately this series was championed primarily</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.418" id="p215" end="00:10:31.479">by Clint Rutkas who has been involved in almost all of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.480" id="p216" end="00:10:34.017">video projects that I have worked on for Microsoft.</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.018" id="p217" end="00:10:36.545">Without Clint, none of this would be possible.</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.546" id="p218" end="00:10:38.146">So please reach out to him on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.147" id="p219" end="00:10:40.299">and let him know how much you appreciate his good work.</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" id="p220" end="00:10:43.510">Okay so enough setup.</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.511" id="p221" end="00:10:48.510">You&#39;ve got Visual Studio 2015 running on Windows 10</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.833" id="p222" end="00:10:51.392">and you&#39;ve turned on Developer mode in Settings</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.393" id="p223" end="00:10:53.258">like we looked at just a moment ago,</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.259" id="p224" end="00:10:54.784">and you&#39;re wondering what comes next.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.785" id="p225" end="00:10:56.939">Well we&#39;re going to get started in the very next video.</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.940" id="p226" end="00:10:58.133">We&#39;ll see you there.</p>
